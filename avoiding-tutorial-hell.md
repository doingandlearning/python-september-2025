You escape “tutorial hell” by **shifting from guided lessons to problems that bite back**—tasks that either save time at work, serve a real audience, or ship code into the wild. Below is a focused plan that pairs concrete use-cases with resources so you can graduate from passive learning to active problem-solving.

## 1 Diagnose: are you stuck in tutorial hell?

- Common signs include finishing courses but freezing on a blank file, or endlessly tweaking someone else’s template without understanding it. ([reddit.com][1], [blog.boot.dev][2])
- The fix is to pick a project that matters to **you**; tutorials then become reference material, not the main event. ([reddit.com][1])

## 2 Pick a “real” use-case (choose one per quarter)

| Domain                   | Starter Idea                                                                                                      | Why it’s real                                                      | Quick ramp-up                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work automation**      | Batch-rename audio files, generate compliance reports, or auto-e-mail daily stats.                                | Direct time-savings and visibility to your team.                   | Chapters 9–13 of _Automate the Boring Stuff_ plus Reddit threads on applying it to Excel / Word workflows. ([reddit.com][3])                                        |
| **Open-source for good** | Fix a “good first issue” on a project aligned with climate, health or accessibility.                              | Publicly visible code + mentorship from maintainers.               | goodfirstissue.dev filters Python repos; MeaningfulCode.org matches projects to causes. ([goodfirstissue.dev][4], [goodfirstissue.dev][5], [meaningfulcode.org][6]) |
| **Data challenges**      | Enter a Kaggle beginner competition (Titanic, House Prices) and write a public notebook explaining your workflow. | Forces end-to-end ownership: data cleaning → modelling → write-up. | Kaggle “competitions” page lists difficulty; Wired reports how this visibility leads to hiring. ([kaggle.com][7], [wired.com][8])                                   |
| **Internal tooling**     | Package a newsroom helper library (e.g. `bbc_titlecase`) or a CLI that pulls programme metadata from the BBC API. | Eliminates spreadsheet gymnastics for colleagues.                  | BBC case study on production-ready Python shows deployment patterns. ([cambridgespark.com][9])                                                                      |
| **Civic/open data**      | Publish a local dataset (e.g. FOI releases) via Datasette and add a tiny Flask front-end.                         | Tangible benefit for journalists or the public.                    | Datasette primer for data-journalists and archivists. ([medium.com][10])                                                                                            |
| **Innovation contests**  | Hackathon such as IBM Call for Code or NHS “AI for good” sprints.                                                 | Deadlines and team dynamics replicate real delivery pressure.      | Example: Project OWL turned a hack into disaster-response tech. ([wired.com][11])                                                                                   |

## 3 Turn the idea into an executable plan

1. **Define the smallest useful outcome** (e.g. “rename 200 audio clips in one click”).
2. **Time-box** exploration: 1 week for proof-of-concept, 3 weeks polish.
3. **Treat gaps as search queries**, not course hunts—read docs, Stack Overflow, Real Python articles only when blocked. ([reddit.com][1], [dataquest.io][12])
4. **Publish something**: a CLI on PyPI, a notebook on Kaggle, or a pull-request. The act of shipping cements learning and provides feedback loops.

## 4 Keep skills sharp without new tutorials

- **Weekly challenges** such as Python Morsels or Exercism keep syntax fresh in <30 min a week. ([dataquest.io][12])
- **Code review**: swap pull-requests with a peer or mentor; reviewing others’ code is free mastery.
- **Documentation sprints**: updating README files or docstrings on open-source projects builds clarity and community footprint simultaneously.

## 5 Avoiding relapse

- **One-in, one-out rule**: for every new course you bookmark, archive an old one and log what concept you still need.
- **Project > tutorial ratio**: spend at least 2 hours building for every 1 hour of video watched.
- **Demo days**: schedule a 10-minute internal show-and-tell each month; public deadlines crush perfectionism paralysis.

### Quick checklist

- [ ] I have a problem someone actually cares about.
- [ ] The scope fits 2–4 weeks.
- [ ] I know where my code will live (GitHub repo, internal server, Kaggle notebook).
- [ ] I’ve identified one community (Slack, Discord, or forum) for help.
- [ ] My calendar includes a “ship” date and a demo slot.

Pick one path, commit to a deadline, and let the inevitable hurdles replace the comfort of yet another video series.
