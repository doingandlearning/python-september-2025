## Course Overview

This three-day course offers a practical, hands-on journey into the world of Python programming. We'll cover the essential language features and build your skills progressively. To make the learning concrete and engaging, our labs will follow a central theme: analyzing real-world news headlines. You'll start with basic scripts and build up to a final project that fetches live news from the internet, processes the data, and generates an analysis report. By the end, you'll have the confidence to apply Python to practical data-handling tasks.
