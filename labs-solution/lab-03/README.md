## How to Use These Solutions

### For Learning
1. **Try the lab exercises yourself first** - don't peek at solutions until you're stuck!
2. **Compare your code** with the solutions to see different approaches
3. **Experiment** with the code - modify values, add new features
4. **Run each step file** to see how the game builds up gradually

### For Reference
- Use these as templates for similar problems
- Study the code organization and commenting
- Note the variable naming and structure
- See how concepts build upon each other

## Running the Programs

All programs can be run from the command line:

```bash
python guessing_game.py
python step_01_setup.py
python step_02_loop.py
python step_03_logic.py
python step_04_win_loss.py
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Loops**: Using `for` loops with `range()`
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- **Control Flow**: `break` statement to exit loops early
- **User Input**: Getting and validating user input
- **Game State**: Tracking whether the player has won
- **Random Numbers**: Using the `random` module
- **String Formatting**: Creating user-friendly output

## Concepts Used (Lab 3 Appropriate)

These solutions use concepts covered in Lab 3:
- `for` loops with `range()`
- `if/elif/else` conditional statements
- `break` statement
- `input()` and `print()` functions
- Variables and assignment
- Basic arithmetic operations
- String concatenation and f-strings

## Next Steps

After completing this lab, you should be comfortable with:
- Creating programs that loop a specific number of times
- Making decisions based on user input
- Controlling program flow with conditional statements
- Building interactive games and applications

Move on to Lab 4: Container Types to learn about lists, tuples, and other data structures!
