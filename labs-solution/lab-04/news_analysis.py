# Lab 4: Analyzing News Headlines - Complete Solution
# This program demonstrates working with lists, loops, and string operations

# Step 1: Create a list of headlines
headlines = [
    "General election: Labour and Tories clash over tax",
    "England crowned T20 world champions",
    "Summer travel chaos feared as airline strikes loom",
    "UK inflation rate falls to lowest level in three years",

# Step 2: Count the headlines

# Step 3: Calculate the average headline length
total_words = 0
for headline in headlines:
    # Split each headline into words and count them
    words = headline.split()
    total_words += len(words)

# Calculate and display the average
average_words = total_words / total_headlines

print()

# Step 4: Find headlines about a specific topic
print("-" * 40)

# Search through headlines (case-insensitive)
