# Lab 2: Types - Solutions

This folder contains complete solutions for all exercises in Lab 2: Types.

## Files Overview

### Individual Step Solutions

1. **`interactive_hello.py`** - Step 1: Making the application interactive
   - Demonstrates user input with `input()` function
   - Shows string concatenation and variables

2. **`number_calculator.py`** - Step 2: Inputting numbers and calculations
   - Shows how to convert string input to numbers
   - Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations
   - Displays type information

3. **`string_explorer.py`** - Steps 3-4: String operations and type conversion
   - String concatenation examples
   - Type conversion between strings and numbers
   - Shows common pitfalls and solutions

4. **`none_explorer.py`** - Step 5: Using the None value
   - Explains what None is and how to use it
   - Shows proper comparison methods (`is None`, `is not None`)
   - Includes practical examples

### Comprehensive Solutions

5. **`types_demo.py`** - Complete combined program
   - Integrates all concepts from the lab
   - Includes professional output formatting
   - Demonstrates best practices

## How to Use These Solutions

### For Learning
1. **Try the lab exercises yourself first** - don't peek at solutions until you're stuck!
2. **Compare your code** with the solutions to see different approaches
3. **Experiment** with the code - modify values, add new features
4. **Run each file** to see the output and understand the flow

### For Reference
- Use these as templates for similar problems
- Study the code organization and commenting
- Note the variable naming and structure

## Running the Programs

All programs can be run from the command line:

```bash
python interactive_hello.py
python number_calculator.py
python string_explorer.py
python none_explorer.py
python types_demo.py
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **User Input**: Using `input()` function
- **Type Conversion**: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
- **String Operations**: Concatenation, methods
- **Type Checking**: Using `type()` function
- **Variables**: Storing and manipulating data
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication
- **String Methods**: `len()`, `upper()`, `lower()`

## Concepts Used (Lab 2 Appropriate Only)

These solutions only use concepts covered in Lab 2:
- Variables and assignment
- `input()` and `print()` functions
- Basic arithmetic operators
- String concatenation with `+`
- Type conversion functions (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`)
- `type()` function
- `None` value and comparisons
- Basic string methods

## Next Steps

After completing this lab, you should be comfortable with:
- Getting user input and storing it in variables
- Converting between different data types
- Understanding Python's type system
- Basic string and number operations

Move on to Lab 3: Flow Control to learn about decision-making and loops!
